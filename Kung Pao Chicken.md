This spicy hot chicken dish can be toned down easily by limiting the amount of hot peppers.

Ingredients
-----------

* 1/2 c. raw peanuts
* 2 c. boneless chicken (approximately 2 breasts cut into 1 1/4 inch cubes. Dark chicken meat can also be used.)
* 1 T. soy sauce
* 1 T. cornstarch
* 6 whole dried red chili peppers, or to taste
* 3 scallions cut into 1/4” slices (green part only)
* 1 clove garlic, finely minced
* 1 t. finely minced ginger root

### Seasoning Sauce
* 2 T. soy sauce
* 1 T. dry sherry
* 2 t. sugar
* 1 t. white vinegar
* 1 t. toasted sesame oil

* 1/4 c. peanut oil (for stir frying)

Instructions
------------

1. While readying other ingredients, roast nuts in a 400º oven for 15 minutes or until golden.
2. In a small bowl, combine chicken with soy sauce and cornstarch; mix well and set aside
3. Wipe chili peppers with dampened towel, remove tips, and set on plate. Place scallions, garlic, and ginger on separate plate near cooking area; place roasted peanuts alongside other ingredients.
4. Combine soy sauce, sherry sugar, vinegar, and sesame oil, and stir to form seasoning sauce.
5. Heat wok or heavy cast iron skillet; add peanut oil, and when very hot, stir-fry red peppers until they turn dark red; add chicken and continue to stir-fry over high heat for 3 minutes or until chicken turns opaque. Remove chicken with slotted spoon, leaving excess oil in pan. (note - for vegetarian option, no need to remove from pan.)
6. Add scallions, ginger, and garlic; stir-fry for 1 minute. Return chicken, add seasoning sauce, and stir-fry for 1 minute to combine flavors.
7. Add peanuts, stir, and serve immediately over white rice.
