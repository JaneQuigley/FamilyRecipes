Chicken Breasts With Lemon
==========================

- Yield: 4 servings

- Time: 25 minutes

Michael Kraus for The New York Times

In this recipe, which Pierre Franey brought to The Times in 1992 in one
of his 60-Minute Gourmet columns, two teaspoons of lemon zest are added
to a simple sauce of lemon juice, thyme, garlic and shallots. It is, at
once, lively and elegant. To round it out, it needs a sturdy
accompaniment. Mr. Franey suggested [*mashed potatoes with garlic and
basil*](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/4118-mashed-potatoes-with-garlic-and-basil),
with just a little olive oil swirled in.

Ingredients
-----------

- ½ cup flour for dredging

- Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

- 4 skinless boneless chicken breasts, about 6 ounces each

- 2 tablespoons olive oil

- 4 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried

- 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots

- 2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic

- 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest

- 3 tablespoons lemon juice

- ½ cup chicken broth, fresh or canned

- 2 tablespoons butter

Instructions
------------

1.  Season flour with salt and pepper, and dredge the chicken all over.
    Remove the excess flour.

2.  Heat the oil in a heavy skillet large enough to hold the chicken
    pieces in one layer. Add chicken and cook, uncovered, over medium
    heat for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.

3.  Flip the chicken and cook for 5 minutes more, or until cooked
    through. Carefully remove the oil from the skillet, leaving the
    chicken. Discard the oil.

4.  Add the thyme, shallots and garlic, and cook for about a minute. Do
    not burn the garlic. Add the lemon rind, the lemon juice and the
    broth.

5.  Scrape the skillet to dissolve the brown particles that cling to the
    bottom. Add the butter, and cook for 3 minutes longer. Serve
    immediately.
